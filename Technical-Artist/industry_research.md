# My Strength

Multidisciplinary background
- NUS CS + Math double major
- AI Specialization
- Visual art background
- Martial Arts (MMA/Taekwondo) and Performance Arts (Drama)

# Path A: Rigging & Character Technology (The "Motion" Specialist)

*Focus: Anatomy, Kinematics, and Automation.*

**The Synergy:** This path transforms my Martial Arts & Drama background into a technical asset. My understanding of body mechanics, weight transfer, and emotional expression allows me to architect rigs that are not just mathematically correct, but distinctively "alive."

**Core Competencies:**
- Tech: Python Scripting, Maya/Blender API, Tool Development.
- Art: Facial expression logic, muscle deformation, anatomical constraints.

**AI Integration:**
- Physics-based Animation: Utilizing Reinforcement Learning (RL) for procedurally generated character movement.
- Neural Rigging: Replacing linear blend skinning with Deep Learning models for realistic tissue deformation.

# Path B: Rendering & Graphics (The "Visual" Specialist)

*Focus: Light, Mathematics, and Optimization.*

**The Synergy:** This path maximizes my Math & CS foundation. It applies advanced linear algebra and calculus to simulate reality, focusing on the "science of sight", from photon transport to GPU architecture.

**Core Competencies:**
- Tech: HLSL/GLSL Shaders, Render Pipelines (URP/HDRP), PBR (Physically Based Rendering).
- Math: Ray Tracing logic, Monte Carlo integration, Linear Algebra.

**AI Integration:**
- Neural Rendering: Exploring NeRF (Neural Radiance Fields) and Gaussian Splatting for next-gen visualization.
- Real-time Optimization: AI-driven super-resolution (DLSS context) and neural material generation.
